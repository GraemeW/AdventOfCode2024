# Advent of Code 2024

> The Chief Historian is always present for the big Christmas sleigh launch, but nobody has seen him in months! Last anyone heard, he was visiting locations that are historically significant to the North Pole; a group of Senior Historians has asked you to accompany them as they check the places they think he was most likely to visit.
>
> As each location is checked, they will mark it on their list with a star. They figure the Chief Historian must be in one of the first fifty places they'll look, so in order to save Christmas, you need to help them get fifty stars on their list before Santa takes off on December 25th.
>
> Collect stars by solving puzzles. Two puzzles will be made available on each day in the Advent calendar; the second puzzle is unlocked when you complete the first. Each puzzle grants one star. Good luck!

## Running the Solutions

See :: [AdventOfCode2024](/AdventOfCode2024/README.md)

Adjust selectors in `main.cpp` to execute specific day/question as:
```
int main(int argc, const char * argv[]) {
    // Main Selection
    CoreAOC::AdventDay daySelector = CoreAOC::AdventDayOne;
    int sectionSelector = 1;

	// Read-out and execution code followsâ€¦
}
```
